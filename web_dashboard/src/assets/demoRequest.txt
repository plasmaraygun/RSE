The General Theory of Recursive Symbolic Execution (RSE) represents a paradigm shift in computational theory, proposing that infinite logical operations can be simulated within finite computational substrates through symbolic recursion and topological constraints. This paper introduces the foundational concepts of RSE and its relationship to the broader framework of symbolic computation, demonstrating how computational systems can achieve infinite depth through finite means by employing symbolic representations that recursively reference themselves. Unlike traditional symbolic execution which explores program paths, RSE creates self-referential symbolic structures that can simulate unbounded computation within bounded resources.
